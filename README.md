Measure temperature, air pressure, humidity and altitude estimate 
based on air pressure with BME280 sensor and display them on a
SSD1306 OLED display connected with SPI to the tiny Seeeduino XIAO.

This sketch was created by merging example files from Adafruit
for the sensor and OLED, and then expanded to fit my needs.
